# Confessions of a Tech Communicator

I've been fortunate to work for companies that aren't primarily focused on technology. Or, at least, they don't perceive themselves as technology-first. They prioritise their core utility, such as real estate or money transfer, as their primary focus. People come next, followed by technology.

This is an understandable and fair position to hold. People first (or second as it were) is something that separates great companies from good companies, in my experience.  This is because companies that are people first understand that without people thriving and contributing they are only partly as great as they could be.

Although more pronounced in expansive corporations, the same problems can manifest themselves in lean IT startups:  A challenge that I've frequently faced, and struggled with, can be summarised as 'communication.' However, this term is not particularly informative, so let's break it down:

- [Influence is not the same thing as being correct](#influence-is-different-from-being-correct)

- [Tech doesn't know how to get its message across](#getting-your-message-across---the-same-message-wont-work-with-all-audiences)

- [Tech is not percieved as business savvy](#not-considered-business-savvy)

- [Hidden agendas may be afoot](#hidden-agendas)

- [Isolated and inwards focused vs Transparent](#transparency)

- [On the bus, versus trying to take the steering wheel](#on-the-bus-versus-trying-to-take-the-steering-wheel)

- [Not working hard enough at inter-departmental relations](#work-hard-at-departmental-relationships)


## Influence is different from being correct
> "A man with an idea is a fool until he gains an audience." - Harry Truman

It seems to me that people often confuse the notion of having influence with the notion of being correct.  I certainly have.  Tech people steer towards correctness as the all-governing argument.  You may be completely correct.  Or you may be completely incorrect.  But without any influence, you can often get nothing progressed.  Strive to be _influential and correct_.

<em>Influence with research and experimentation</em>
</center>

It should be obvious but it is worthwhile stating regardless: only use your influence when you feel that your information is correct, and/or that your hunch is strong.  If you're in doubt, say so. But being influential when you know that you are wrong is diabolical, dangerous, and unethical.

"How does one cultivate influence?" may then be the pertinent question.
Here are some tips:

- Play the long game.
- Listen a lot.
- Always strive to 'do the right thing.'
- Be accurate and considered in what you say.
- Prepare and become knowledgeable in the subject area.
- Provide context and background to the subject area.
- Be concise and to the point.
- Speak in the common vernacular - speak in a relatable manner.
- Be firm and act with the conviction of your belief, but do not embarrass or embitter others.
- State if you're guessing or hypothesising.
- Support others with better ideas, acknowledging their contributions.
- Speak up if you have an important point, but deliver your message respectfully.
- Speak with humility.
- Seek collaboration.
- Be persistent, but know when to let go and align with mainstream thought.
- Avoid "I told you so" moments, instead bend over backwards to help.
- Review retrospective actions to determine good and bad behavior. Discuss this with the team.
- Be patient.
- Avoid negativity.

It should be recognised that the hierarchical organisational power dynamic certainly has an impact on how much influence you have.  Influence up the hierarchy is typically tougher to attain than influence across the hierarchy than is influence down the hierarchy.

### Trust creates influence
Influence is largely manifest out of trust.  It may also come from authority - but authority is a sad excuse for influence; because it breeds arrogance, a culture of power-mongering and territory gaming, a lack of autonomy, low-morale.  I won't continue.  So, influence from authority should be a last resort and reserved for when 1) there is no other option or time is critically short, _and_ 2) you are certain that your position is correct.

Long term trust is a function of reliability, by doing what you say and have committed to. Be considered in what you sign up for and think about things from a long term, trust based perspective.  It's easy to jump onto offering yourself or your team's time to take on a job.  But will you do it?  And do you have the time to do it?  Or did you just say yes to portray the impression of generosity?  Regardless, commit and deliver.  This is a good motto.  Actions are the result of purposeful endeavour; endeavour to be known for getting things done.

>“Words without actions are meaningless.” – Mahatma Gandhi

For our purposes, we could change Ganhi's quote to "A 'yes' without an action is meaningless".

Trust doesn't build over night and can take time.  Trust necessarily is a long-term game.  Work on building trust.  And work on it for the long term.  This will, in turn, build your influence.

Would you trust yourself to deliver?  What's your track record? It's worth a thought.

### Correctness, persistence, and knowing when to move on.  Or you win some, you lose some.
Margaret Thatcher's quote resonates often in my head and is applicable here: 
>"You may have to fight a battle more than once to win the war".

This means that if you are certain that you are correct, you should persist.  Until you shouldn't.

One company that I worked for (a really great company to work for by the way) decided to outsource the implementation of one of our strategic and popular software products to a third party. I was very opposed to the outsourcing for a number of reasons.  The decision was delayed given my opposition until a meeting between department heads; technology and marketing.  After that meeting, I was told to 'pull my head in' and that 'tech shouldn't be involved in strategic business related decisions'.

And so I pulled my head in and got back on the bus.  The bus was full throttle down the road of integration and 3rd party implementation.  What was important was that after that decision, and that very short discussion, I committed myself and my entire team's efforts to ensuring the implementation's success.  And I mean fully committed.  I remember my team working over Christmas break to meet tight deadlines, re-shaping our roadmap and backlog to suit, spending a lot of time advising and relaying our knowledge, spending a lot of our time testing thier implementation.

I had disagreed with the decision mainly due to architectural limitations and also the difficulty of translating product requirements to this 3rd party.  These concerns, among others, turned out to be substantiated unfortunately.  And over a year and a half after the promised deadline, and after the scalping of a high-level colleague, we cancelled the 3rd party contract, and brought the implementation back in-house. It was completed in less than four months.

The point here is that I had my say; I had some influence but clearly not enough persuasiveness.  I stood strong behind my concerns about the difficulty of integration and of relaying business requirements.  My concern was escalated and I again had my say. A decision was made to integrate against my will.   So even though my concerns were correct and substantiated in the final analysis, that didn't hold in the initial decision making process.  The important part is that I moved into a fully supportive mode attempting to help ensure the project's success.

The other point is that before bringing the project back in house, we were asked to attend a high-level meeting as to what the options for the project were.  At this stage, our department's influence was such (and perhaps an annoying lesson had been learned) that when we suggested to bring the project back in house, that is what everyone agreed.

There was another hugely positive outcome from this long exercise.  Our commitment to the project was heralded by marketing, and we moved from a strained, untrusting relationship to a fully collaborative, 2-way respectful relationship.  We became a true team where saying 'no' was respected, where we collaborated strongly on projects and their implementations, both parties having a strong say in all considerations.

## Getting your message across - The same message won't work with all audiences

Tech people are often to the point, direct, and typically are wonderful word-economists.  Or sometimes they can fit into the other extreme whereby their verbosity is great, with vast amounts of fine-grained detail.  This manner of communication is not often suitable for wider non-technical audiences. When engaging with an audience, the messaging should be different to how it is presented to technical colleagues.

<div align="center">
<img src="./General images/SpeakingToDifferenceAudiences.drawio.png">

<em>Communicating to audience types will ehance understanding</em>
</div>


Communication is simply not a one-size-fits-all approach.  Even to technical people, Donald Knuth argued through his concept of literate programming that interweaving human-oriented prose into the source code destined for compilers made the understanding of the source code less onerous on the human. Here he used a mechanism to output code in a human-digestable representation of what the code was doing.  The same mechanism also output the code, in a compiler ready format and order.  In this way he attempted to solve the problem of representing the same truth to a human audience and, simultaneously, the compiler.

Different audiences require different messaging. Adjust your message to the audience and thier need to understand the message.  I doubt whether it is possible to have 100% information transfer (transfer of meaning) between two parties, but you will certainly achieve a transfer rate that is a great deal less if you don't adjust your messaging to the audience.

Who is it that you're communicating with?  Communicating with board members is starkly different to communicating to your team, or your fellow leaders.  And this again different to communicating with an Executive committee.

Moreover, within a software department alone, communicating with developers is different to communicating with architects, Product people, UX, testing, for example.  Consider the below excerpt:

>I love the term storyteller. I think that describes it very effectively. What I often say is that a software architect has to be multilingual. They have to understand business, they have to understand developer, and they have to understand product management, and all of those the deep understanding of the language that's important to those individuals, because they have to communicate the business need to people who don't know anything about business, necessarily, or connected to the business very closely, and need to understand in the language of a software developer, and understand how to talk to them in their own language and how to talk to a product management in their own language, et cetera. You're [sic] right. I think the term storyteller is a good model for that, is you have to understand the language to the point where you can explain what you're trying to do in a way that they all can understand, which is a form of storytelling ~Josh Prismon, https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SED1595-SED1595_IndexExchange.txt


Know Your Audience.  Imagine a board meeting as compared to a team update. Board members are laser-focused on the big picture, strategic goals, and impact on the bottom line. Your team, on the other hand, needs details, challenges they can tackle, and a sense of progress. It's all about relevance.

Stakeholders and execs don't typcially want to know about tech debt and a granular feature that you've implemented.  But they do want to know about the progress of the project and that users are satisfied with the latest release.  A very large project that I was involved with in the past had a hard and aggressive deadline. I would message a few of the exec regularly; they could not have cared less about each individual feature, about anything other than two things: 1) are we on track to deliver? And 2) what was our justification for our confidence.  Every now and then they needed third piece of information : 3) what's the plan to get back on track?

And lastly, but probably most important to get your message across, adapt your message by checking with the audience, or looking for queues from the audience as to whether your message is resonating.  Ask them "Does that make sense?".  Look for attentive, engaged people.  Speak to them by looking at them in the eyes.  Restate things in a different manner so that they understand more fully.

If the matter is too technical, attempt to find analogies instead.  Or speak to a different abstraction level.  And remember Einstein's quote:

> "If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand it yourself." - Albert Einstein


### Bring the audience up to speed

Even if the content has been covered before, it is OK to bring someone up to date on what is being discussed previoulsy and why; in fact it is crucial I find. Over and over again you can often make the mistake of forgetting that not everyone is buried deep in the problem space as you are.  Or they just aren't as familiar, or perhaps they just aren't as 'quick' as you are - remember this doesn't make them any less wise --- (we cover this later).  I've worked with tech people who have been 2 weeks ahead of me the moment I utter the first sentence; they would jump immediately on to the nature of the content and quickly get to the conclusion.  It was impressive.  But!... not everyone is the same.  And perhaps there is nuance in your message; a subtlety that they do not pick up on.  So, take the time to explain:

- State the problem in a clear sentence that a 10 year old could understand. OK.  A 14 year old.
- Discuss the workflow from a user's perspective.  The user logs in to this site and navigates to the shopping cart after choosing a product to purchase.  When the user logs in to another browser tab... you get the picture.  As opposed to 'multiple user sessions can create a conflict in the shopping cart'.  Take your time to explain.
- Use the actual application to demonstrate the functionality at hand.
- Ask if people understand what is being discussed.
- Allow for questions and manage them; less important, or off-topic questions can be postponed to a later time; not dismissed as irrelevant but treated with care and respect.

Follow in this manner bringing people along with you.  Remember that you are not delivering just a fact, or list of facts.  You are not trying to get your way.  You are trying to get the best outcome. You are educating, or at least illuminating.

### Avoid 1-way communication
Demos to stakeholders are important and interestingly, part of the scrum ritual.  In my experience they don't happen in favour of internal 'demos'.  Regardless of whether scrum is utilised as a work-practice or not, the key here is that it is highly preferential to involve stakeholders in your reviews.  The benefits are many and the down-sides are many too.  But the downsides are manifest in unhealthy business cultures.  And we should all attempt to promote, or at least strive towards a positive, healthy business culture.

So, attempt to use reviews to showcase to stakeholders progress that you are making, or otherwise.  Allow them to feed into the decision making process.  This can be hard, I know, because feeding into the decision making process is not the same as having free-reign decision making ability; and sometimes stakeholders assume that this is the case.  Carefully managed however, this can be avoided, and a happy balance found.

In the past, I've partaken in these kinds of reviews, but they were often uni-directional.  While they were full of good intent, I would afterwards hear comments like "We've got no idea what's happening." "I wish we knew what they're working on." "We don't understand how things are progressing."  And so on.  Literally straight after the review.  This is more common than I care to mention and can frustrate _all_ parties involved.  And through no small attempt from the 'tech' department, sometimes preparing elaborate feature updates.  But clearly, either one, all, or some, of the following are true:

1. The stakeholders did not get to have their input.  Not having input, after all, is very often expressed as "I wish I knew what they are working on", or similar.  The above comments are often simply synonyms for stakeholders wanting input.  I've queried this many times and often arrived at this conclusion.
2. The audience of the information did not understand
3. They were not paying attention

Remember, ensure key people, stakeholders get to have their say.


### Provide context through a structured approach: follow a common pattern and use a common format

Not understanding and not paying attention are often symptomatic of the same thing:  context, or rather, lack of context.

Get yourself and your audience used to presenting information in a common format. For example, a project update should use the same format during each stakeholder meeting.  This should be presented on a one-page Wiki-like page that everyone can view.  

Here are some simple guidelines for the project update:

<div align=center>
<img src="./General images/ProjectUpdate.drawio.png">

<em>Project review time split</em>
</div>

At the beginning of each meeting it is worthwhile to spend a couple of minutes to remind everyone of:

1. The purpose of the meeting.  Tell them why they're here and present.
2. The project headline.
3. The problem definition.
4. The goal of the project.  This should be a sentence of two and have been agreed to by all parties.
5. The current scope of the project : This should be a bullet point list of the key deliverables for the project at hand.


This may all sound a bit needless, if not somewhat contrived, however this is a very important step as a prelude to the actual update.  In a couple of short minutes, we've provided good context to our audience.  It's surprising how much people can forget what was previously agreed to.  It is also surprising how a quick refresher of the goal and the scope of the project helps keep the conversation on track.  The chances of the scope changing unnecessarily are reduced significantly by simply referring back to the just-discussed scope of the project.  This process allows for a kind of centering to take place and a reminder of the previous works; giving people time to remind themselves of useful information (hopefully).

Defining an MVP can be contentious and hard enough, let alone it changing at whim every project update.  Remember the cliched, but very true and useful advice of public speaking: tell them what you're going to say, say what you're going to say, then tell them what you've said.  And then, even then they may not remember!


6. Demo the features recently added, but remind the audience of the context of why you are building what you're building.  Talking about the feature is all good, but I often find that the context of the why the feature is being build in the first place, and how it relates to previous works, is often missing.  Consider demo-ing not just the features that have just been implemented, but also the entire user-journey that culminates in the use of the feature.

7. Ask for feedback on the current implementation.  

8. Remember that it may very well be that changes are requested.  This is normal.  Of course, typically, a change will necessitate a growth in the scope of the project.  And the Product Owner's role will come to the fore her as they attempt to do the right thing by the end-user, the stakeholder, and the development team.  (Ultimately it is the end user who will dictate terms via market appeal of the product, however the stakeholders (who may be sponsoring the project) and the development team (who possess the skillset to make what's required) must be heeded).  And guiding the audience on the importance of the requested change against the ability of the team(s) to meet the targetted delivery date will need to be carefully considered.  I tend to be very firm on this and typically will only negotiate on works that ensure a better or safer user workflow, or were obviously missed when crafting the MVP for the current release.  It's OK to say "No" as long as you justify why.  A successful delivery is far more satisfactory than delivering an extra bell and whistle instead.  Saying "No.  Although I really like that idea a lot, if we were to implement it, we'd delay the project by about 2 weeks.  This is something that we could introduce in the subsequent release" is a lot better than just "No".

9. Give an update of the overall progress of the project; good, bad, or OK.  
    
    Give an update of remaining work and how things are progressing to the target delivery date.  A burndown is very handy here, but other metrics can also be used.


    As an important side-note: Be honest.  Beware of the slippery slope of the 'almost finished monster'.  The monster that bites your head off during the following project update where you still aren't finished!  And so on. The conversations I've had regarding the temptation of reporting progress to present a better view of the actual progress of the project are many!  This may seem surprising; I don't know, but I encourage you to stand fast, give a transparent account, and don't get eaten by the monster.

10. Briefly discuss the key new features that are about to be implemented in the next iteration.

11. Review the risks of the project quickly and address the likelihood of the risks being actualised.




## Not considered business savvy
Unless integrated well into the business, tech can be seen as a cost centre, and sometimes as a necessary evil.  And we, as tech people, can often be seen as 'those tech guys'; the people that do the bidding of the decision makers.  Attempting to input into business decisions of a commercial ilk as a technical person can seem as being condescending to the 'business' folk, or at least being well outside the remit of 'Tech'.

A part of the reason, I believe, is because of the ease of arriving at the conflated thought that 1) business domain knowledge, and 2) building of valuable software are one in the same thing.  While there is a good overlap between these two concepts of course, they are not the same thing.  And someone who is good at one may not necessarily be good at the other.  Certainly to build good software you need a deep understanding of the business domain, but the same does not stand true the other way around; having good business domain knowledge does not mean that you will build good software. But how do you explain this to a high level executive who is telling you that you don't understand the business; who are you to think that introducing this fancy feature will work at all? 

This can be a difficult one to overcome.  But here are some ideas:

### Treat an idea as an experiment
Introduce a culture of experimentation whereby new concepts are able to be trialled with a (statistically significant) part of the user population to determine whether the concept should be adopted.  This is another way of saying; "We suspect there is value in implementing a new feature; let's find out and if it works by doing a basic implementation and getting it in front of a user audience.  Then through empirical metrics we can determine if we should proceed with the concept."  But this requires a cultural shift in the organisation's ways of approaching problem solving.  However, if you have the supportive technology to perform A:B testing, feature toggling, or slotted deployments, or similar, then this is a great solution.  In fact, there is a strong argument to say that this method should be employed holistically and that this approach sits side-by-side with an agile mindset.

### Share the problem

Collaborating interdepartmentally can go a long way towards preventing resentful behaviour that denies the progress of what should be done, or should be done a better way.

Sharing the problem involves you and your team sharing the problem definition yet owning the solution.  If you can involve others in the process of defining the problem, it has a habit of creating buy-in.  Solutioning is the domain of the team, but this does not mean that the team can't be extended, even informally, to involve other members from other departments.  This is the nature of cross-functional teams.  And involving key people in the solutioning process can be an excellent way to make progress, share concerns, and create good future alignment between different departments.

Take care to differentiate the problem from the solution.  The problem should be stated and recorded accurately, as exactly that; a problem (in the negative). (E.g., Users need to wait 1 day to determine their accumulated activity score after finishing an exercise session.) The goal here is to be able to explain the problem in a few easy to understand sentences. This is important because problem forumalation then opens the door to formulating a hypothesis of how a solution may resolve the problem.  And from there you are able to ascertain what success metrics may be to determine if the solution actually resolved the problem. 

Avoid being handed the solution by well-meaning people.  Instead, again, go back to basics.  Define the problem first.  And then and only then begin progressing with the team towards what a solution may look like.  There are exceptions where this may not be possible, but this should truly be an _exception_.

This is harder than it seems usually, but working closely with key business people and stakeholders is so often the answer than it is to ignore, progress, and then be held back after the solution has been built.


### Review the facts and make certain that they tell the whole story

Come armed with useful facts and good questions.  Do your research.  Don't expect to be influential without an understanding of the domain of interest.  Ensure that you understand the key points of your argument and can articulate them in a concise manner.

Once, I received a directive from higher management to discontinue a valuable mobile app due to its perceived status as a loss generator. The app's license purchases were not covering costs, seemingly rendering it unprofitable. However, what wasn't initially taken into account was the indirect impact on sales attributable to the mobile app. With this re-evaluated metric, and through a strategic renegotiation of a costly integration with the app, we successfully turned the situation around, leading to a renewed appreciation for the app as the unique and beneficial tool that it was.


## Hidden agendas

Sometimes the reasoning for a decision is on a need to know basis, and sometimes it is deemed that you do not need to know. You are simply not privy to the necessary information. In this case, it's often best to carry on to accumulate your information to justify your position.  After attempting to do so, and while doing so, you simply just need to get 'on the bus'.  Determining that you are not privy to the information is not always a simple process unless you are explicitly told.  And you may only find out some time in the future. 

<div align=center>
<img src="./General images/hidenAgenda.drawio.png" width=250>
</div>

An illustrative anecdote involves a situation where the company was about to invest in a technology that was conservatively four times the cost of a superior, more established technology.  The numbers were eye-watering, and compounding this, the cost was being written against my department.  Despite building a compelling, well-researched and firm business case that demonstrated both significant cost savings and the feature advantages of the alternative technology platform, I was informed that my business case was submitted late - even though it was delivered before the agreed date.

Typically there are two paths in challenging scenarios.  One of the paths is logically sound.  Even if you may not agree with it, you understand with the reasoning.  The other path involves actions that seem incongruent with stated goals, indicating a potential hidden agenda.  While it's crucial to challenge decisions and seek clarity, persistent deviation from stated goals might indicate covert operations.

Remember that words can sometimes be cheap. It is always useful to take measure of the actions that have played out instead and determine if there is an assymmetry between the actions over time and the rhetoric.  If there is a marked difference, then consider that you may very well not be holding all the cards. 

When you lack access to crucial information, consider stating and documenting your case, remaining respectful and honorable. If the project's success isn't critical to survival, it might be prudent to acknowledge the limited sphere of influence, focus on battles where you can exert more impact, and gracefully move forward.

## Transparency

### Transparency till it hurts
Transparency seems to be an anaemic term that recieves liberal use but little conviction.  Very much like the words 'agile', and 'kindness', for example (oops!  Did I just say that?).  Whether that's deemed a little harsh, transparency is a discipline that struggles to be put into practice.

<div align=center>
<img src="./General images/stoolOfTransparency.drawio.png" width=150>

<em>Sitting on the stool of Transparency</em>
</div>

To be fair, it is simply impossible to be 100% transparent.  If not only because we all have our biases and these biases necessarily affect the portrayal of the disseminated information.  

But one rule of thumb of transparency is: Do your actions of being transparent make it uncomfortable to do so?  Might it be easier to mask over the information?

When being transparent, do you find that in doing so sometimes, you're also being courageous?

It really does suck to inform stakeholders that the project isn't going to plan, that the team recently dropped the ball on a critical quality issue, that morale is not great,  that you just blew the budget, that your latest attempts at resolving security vulnerabilities didn't go to plan, that you need to delay the start of an upcoming project, that despite architectural endeavours performance is not yet rectified.

The more practiced you are at being transparent, the easier it becomes to deliver untoward information.  This is not meant to imply that all news is bad news of course, but rather, sometimes one can fall foul of avoiding delivering the bad news in favour of a short term gain. 

What was a famous saying of Nietsche? "What deosn't kill me only makes me stronger"?  Very applicable in this case.

### Transparency up the hierarchy
The antithesis of transparency is hidden information and half-truths.  It's weasel words (that is an official term used in one company that I know of to describe suggested messaging without implicating oneself) and obfuscation.  It's long-winded and obscuring.  We've all seen it and we can all recognise it; usually.

It is easier than it seems to get caught in the trap of non-transparency.  A great example of when this happens is when a leader of a department is asked how their team is performing.  The leader ignores all the negative information and creates a picture of near perfection.  Typically this is because the team's performance is seen as a reflection of the leader's capabilities.  And leaders have egos as well as other incentives. Perhaps there is truth in this leader's statement, but I have heard the 'picutre of perfection' argument so often that I've grown to be wary of it.

> "My team is making excellent progress and are so very productive" (despite the lack of progress).  "They have a strong rapport and culture is excellent" (despite the high attrition rate).

The truth makes you more accountable.  And if you confront things, you may find that you may be seen as a strong leader who takes action and leads through challenging times.  You may find that you'll recieve positive acknowledgement for you efforts and possibly also some help:

> "We have a problem in my team that we're focusing on: we have a productivity issue and have missed a couple of targets lately.  I've spoken to the team and we all have acknowledged it.  There is a positive spirit to improve on this.  We talked about pride in our work and the ability to say 'no' to distractions.  We'll take measure in the next iteration and look for improvements.  I'll keep you updated of how things transpire."

### Transparency down the hierarchy

When talking to our team, one should always strive to provide clear and good reasoning behind important decisions.  As a team lead, or a leader of any sort, we (should) all know that transparency is key for robust business function.  Transparency of reasoning behind decisions is critical.  Don't ever delude yourself that a quiet audience means that they have swallowed your message.  People are not stupid and can almost always detect mistruths, what's not said, or curiously delivered messages.  If you can't tell the truth, then say that you can't say so.  All this to say that there aren't elegant ways to get the message across of course.

And no, the pitfalls of pureist transparency are not lost on me. Of course there are private discussions that you should never expose.  It's up to you to find the balance.  You should not break the trust given to you by people in the organisation.

Here's a question:  how do the actions of "kindness", "honesty", and "vulnerability" relate with regards to transparency?


## On the bus, versus trying to take the steering wheel

You're meant to be on the bus.  The entire company should all be heading in the same direction to the same destination.  And sometimes you can see the bus about to drive over the bridge but the bridge is broken.  No one is listening; your input is all but disregarded.  You end up driving over the bridge, and your input is sought to repair the bridge, and the bus.  You become the fixit King (or Queen).

If this happens repeatedly, indicating a cultural issue, find the right time and way to illustrate to key stakeholders what went wrong, how it could have been avoided, and what can be done in the future to prevent a similar scenario. However, avoid throwing people under the bus (metaphorical pun intended). It's easy to complain about having foreseen the problem.

But many people can claim the same thing probably.  And regardless of whether you're right, no-one likes a know-it-all; really!  But people generally do like someone that introduces a way of doing things, who collaborates with others, who shares problems and solutions, and who persistently fixes and prevents systemic problems from arising again.

One way to do this is when employing the project format and techniques suggested in the 1-way Communication section, ensure that these risks that you forsee are well documented, highlighted, and understood by the stakeholder team. Ensure that your communication is aligned with the stated Vision, Strategy, Goals, and Tactical Goals.

You really need to be on the bus, however.  And if you're not, you are probably in the wrong company.  It's about that simple.  Now, if you've been handed the steering wheel, then all good.  Or if you want to take the bus down another high-way, then all good if everyone agrees.  But you can't put your foot on the brakes and change direction entirely.  You really need to gain consensus. And yes, this is where [Influence is key](#influence-is-different-from-being-correct).



## Adopt some of the jargon, or at least speak English

A great deal of the time, speaking in laymans terms can be the difference between successful and unsuccessful communication.  It's not particularly easy for many tech people to do this.  Undoubtedly some have a talent, but the quintessential techy may not use phrasing that elevates the description of the problem to the relatable abstraction level.  There is often an abstraction gap between technical terminology and the manner in which most people think.  Many tech people are not used to explaining concepts in an abstract manner, and therefore are not particularly good at it.

It can be an innefficient and demanding way of thinking for techies; so the **burden of understanding** shifts necessarily to the audience.  And that doesn't often end with a good result.

But this is key to work on.  Just the mere fact that you recognise that this may be something that you need to work on is a positive step forward; and hopefully your more careful manner to describe ideas will improve continuously.

A small tip: state the information in a technical manner, and then restate it in the more abstract:

> We've succeeded in decoupling key domain logic in our legacy application.  This means that we're able to instrument our build pipeline to reduce build times and also able to perform more granular deployments to production in these specific domains.  
In simpler terms, it's like upgrading your smartphone apps without having to reinstall the entire operating system. This flexibility means we can introduce new features more frequently and with less disruption to the overall system and end users.


## Work hard at departmental relationships

Inter-departmental relationships can easily get to a very strained state and lead to large inneffieciences and nigh-combative stances.
There is little doubt that good inter-departmental relationships need both parties working hard to cultivate a healthy working relationship.  It takes two to tango, as the saying goes.  Assuming that both parties are dancing, some ideas that I've seen work to promote positive inter-departmental relationships:

#### Increase the touch-points between departments.  
The inter-departmental relationship does not only involve you.  It probably makes sense to involve a number of your team and create many healthy inter-departmental relationships.

#### Get out of the way (empower your team)
Although you may be the head of your department, you may not always the best representative for all matters.  Take a sip from that cup of humility again, let the grip of control loosen ever so slightly, and if there is a better person more well-suited, allow them be the go-to person.

#### Make your intentions explicit and public
Make it clear to your team or to your department that you value a strong relationship with the neighboring department.  Explain why it's important and also what your expectations are.  The next time you have a team meeting, present this as a topic and promote this continuously by giving updates on how the relationship is faring.

#### Prefer colloboration over isolation.
Involve people in the neighboring department in your key decisions when sensible; while doing so, be respectful of the departmental hierarchy.

Keep key people informed in other departments.  This may be through project level information that they are not privy to during stakeholder meetings for example.

#### Foster close relationships

Be mindful that good relationships may be enhanced by closer proximity; proximity helps to foster empathy.

Building rapport is the bridge to collaboration.  Establishing good relationships takes effort, and for those of a more introverted nature, means going out of your way to do so.  Consider the correlary of this; keeping people at a distance, which is a sign of a corrosive culture.  You spend 40 hours a week working with people closely; that's a great opportunity to spend it having a laugh, enjoying good company, learning and growing, all the while producing great software.  

Keep people close.  Remember that we are all equals.  Friendliness.  Being approachful.  Being informative; what progress is being made by your team.  What are the future plans are looking like.  You don't have to have a 20 minute water-cooler chat with each person that walks past your desk, but make an effort.

Smalltalk may be cheap and can be considered as frivolous and of little utility.  It's value in terms of pure information and its contribution to business goals is, indeed, virtually zero.  But smalltalk is the dance where we create a rapport, where we figure each other out and figure out how to communicate to one another.  Consider it as a useful and sometimes necesary exercise.  For those that have been burned in their attempts at smalltalk, a smile and a simple "Hello" can go a very long way.

#### Increase trust
[This has been covered already](#trust-creates-influence). Become reliable; commit and deliver.  Don't promise things and not deliver them.

#### Be helpful
Where possible extend a helping hand when you can.  Offer to assist with tasks outside your immediate scope, lend expertise to neighboring projects, and proactively identify opportunities for collaboration.

#### Prefer persuasion over mandating. 
While you may have the authority to make a decision, it is almost always better to not influence and debate.  Your success will depend on bringing people along on the journey.  If for no other reason than that you may very well be wrong, consult and consider and check.  Think of yourself as the final decision maker; in being a final decision maker, you should have consulted with your team, digested the various thoughts, and truly fed them into your decision making process.

#### Strive to accomodate, but uphold your values and principles.

It's crucial to align with business and team goals, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to accommodate various perspectives. However, this adaptability should never come at the cost of compromising your own values and principles in the ever-evolving landscape of technology, where ethical considerations carry substantial weight.

Resisting unethical practices and clearly articulating the reasons behind your stance is a strategic and beneficial move for the long term. While it may bring short-term discomfort, it prompts a pertinent question: 

>"What legacy do you wish to leave in 5 or 10 years?".  

For me, this is a stronger alternative of the consideration:
> "Would I be proud of my actions if my children had full knowledge of the information?" 

This perspective underscores the importance of maintaining ethical standards even in the face of immediate challenges.


#### No matter how hard you try...
Relationships require work, and unless you're actively working on them, it is likely that they are struggling.  Some relationships require a lot of work.  And if the other party is playing politics, or is isolating themselves, it becomes difficult to maintain clear lines of communication, let alone collaboration. (Psychopathic behavior, while useful to undertand, is out of scope for this discussion.)

Anecdotally, I joined a company where the relationship between Product and Engineering was frayed.  And we purposely set an initiative for the entire year, to ensure that we became a 'trusted partner'; thereby putting the onous on our team to embrace and work constructively and informatively with the other department.  Our relationship improved dramatically.

I can think also of a time where regardless of how hard myself and my peer tried, we just could not establish a good relationship with our mutual colleague.  My peer and I had a stated value of "Always do the right thing." and attempted to live this in our engagement with this colleague.  It was a truly terrible situation and one that never resolved properly despite both our attempts, and a number of others attempts and resolving the situation.  If you can honestly say that you've done everything reasonably possible, you simply need to move forward in an intentionally positively collaborative manner, probably inform your manager, and let the cards fall where they will.  And prefer "Always do the right thing" to "Fight fire with fire".


### Don't be a smart-arse; Intellectual arrogance
It may be that you're a gifted and intelligent person and I sincerely hope that you are. Many tech people are.  I've worked with some impressive intellects in my time, and I've often been the least smart person in the room.  It is, however, crucial to note that there is a very big difference between being intelligent and being wise.

And no, I'm not saying that instead of being a smart-arse, you should be a wise-arse.

You need to recognise that although you may be smart, you may not be the wisest person in the room. You may have all the facts and be able to absorb information at a high rate.  You may articulate your thoughts breathtakingly well and with a strong conviction.  These are excellent traits no doubt.

Wisdom, on the other hand, requires the utilisation of this information for **effective decision making**. 

Humility is the key.  And if you possess enough humility, you may find that you end up listening a lot more than you previously had.  That you value and entertain other peoples' opinions more.  You may find that you form opinions a lot later in the process, rather than "knowing" the answer up front.  You may find that you go in to a conversation without the pretence of what you're going to convince the other party of.  And you may find that you aren't faux-listening; pretending that you are listening until you get the chance to say what you've been harboring onto for the past couple of minutes.

I believe that not being an Active Listener is partly due to a symptom of a lack of humility.

I know this because in the past, I've fallen foul of all the above, and I probably still do.  But I actively work on this exercise of humility.  Leave the ego at the door and put the power games aside.  Get the job done, listen and contribute.  With listening comes collaboration.



## Closing Thoughts

As you embark on your professional endeavors, keep in mind that the journey is as significant as the destination. Cultivate relationships, champion transparency, and stand firm in your values. In the end, the mark we leave on our projects, teams, and organisations is a testament to the thoughtful and principled influence we exert.

May your tech endeavors be impactful, your collaborations be fruitful, and your journey be one marked by continuous growth and positive influence. Here's to shaping a future where technology thrives hand in hand with empathy, collaboration, and integrity.  And good communication.
